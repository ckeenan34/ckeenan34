Hi I'm Cam, I love to work on projects that use data to get insights on interesting problems. 
I work full-time as a Software Engineer at Open Systems International Inc and I always have some
kind of side project going. I tend to get the most interested in AI (especially AI that plays games)
and data science/data enigneering. I have experience with python and R for data focused projects and 
I've worked with Java, C# asp.net core, Angular, and Typescript for web development.
